## what is it?

`live-dev-inspector` is a CLI + (optional) web dashboard tool that helps developers **audit their local dev environment** for potential risks like:

- Exposed secrets in `.env` files  
- Weak CORS configurations  
- Open ports and running services  
- Forgotten debug settings or dangerous environment variables  
- Auto-generated security report (Markdown/HTML)
